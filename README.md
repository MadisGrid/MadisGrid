# Hi, I'm Madi!

I'm Software Engineer and and 3D Model Designer from Oahu, Hawaii, working in 3D Modeling and Programming. I enjoy making intuitive programs and creating 3D models in Blender for VR applications. I am persuing a Software Engineering degree and have been actively intering at NASA's Johnson Space Center to persure a career in Softare Engineering.

My experience has been interning on-site at NASA Johnson Space Center working with Projects involving NASA's Metaverse project and creating models for NASA's Virturality Simulations for testing for future mars missions. I have worked actively with Blender, Unreal Engine & Unity to create photo realistic VR Simulations.
